Test Case Design
	In initDatabase.sql, create a database named "eshop" when spring container is in bean injection phase
	Define the following object: Shop, Employee, Customer, Product, SalesOrder
	In prepare phase, read all objects from bean-class-register.xml file and create corresponding table for them in the database
	In test phase, read properties from bean-instatnce.xml file and insert them into the corresponding tables and then read them from database and print them out
	In clear phase, revert the database to the clean status
