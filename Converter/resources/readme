*** Test for PropertyEditor ***
	Define a class with two customed-object properties. Supply the value of each property 
with string. Spring container would find the corresponding editor to convert the string 
value to customed-object property. The two editors are registered in two means. One is by 
registering and another is deined in the same package with the customed-object property.

*** Test for ConversionService ***
	Since conversionService would override the default conversion system based on PropertyEditor, 
we have to use the @Profile mechanism to test this conversion system and above system.
	Redo above test by using ConversionService.

*** Test for Formatter ***
	Redo above test by using Formatter system.

*** Test for validation ***


*** Test for MessageCode to error message ***
	If the validation of conversion failed, then throw error code and the system would convert 
the code to message.
